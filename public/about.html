<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there! I'm Pooja, an aspiring web developer with a passion for crafting digital experiences. My journey into
  the world of technology began with exploring the intricacies of C++, where I honed my problem-solving skills and laid
  the foundation for my coding journey.</p>
<p>I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communications from VTU, a chapter of my life that enriched my
  understanding of the digital landscape. Currently based in the vibrant city of Bangalore, I draw inspiration from its
  dynamic tech scene to continually enhance my skills and keep up with the latest trends in web development.</p>
<p>Beyond the realms of coding, I proudly embrace the role of a mother to a delightful 2.5-year-old daughter. This role
  has taught me invaluable lessons in time management, patience, and multitasking â€“ skills that seamlessly translate
  into the world of web development. </p>
<p>As much as I am devoted to pixels and code, I am equally passionate about health and wellness. I believe in the
  harmony between mind and body, and I'm always excited to explore ways to stay physically active and mentally
  rejuvenated.</p>

<p>With a blend of technical acumen from my engineering background, an eagerness to learn, and an innate curiosity, I'm
  on
  a quest to refine my web development skills and create meaningful digital solutions. Join me on this exhilarating
  journey as I navigate the ever-evolving landscape of technology and leave a mark in the digital realm!</p>
